**Transitions critical engineering** | **Design in Energy 'milieu" & Action-Research** | **Anthropology of infrastructures** | **Dad and a little gicky**

I am an energy and environment engineer by education and trade, I'm working the design of transitions and complex systems by practice, and I'm investigating the becoming and sustainability of our infrastructures and adaptation by interest and necessity. 

### In short
* Active member at [la MYNE](https://lamyne.org).
* Co-producer of [DAISEE](https://daisee.cc).
* Co-initiator of [Oxamyne](https://oxamyne.coop) and associate at [Oxalis SCOP SA](https://oxalis-scop.org)
* Co-operator of the [Fabrique des Bifurcations Energiétiques](https://fabenergies.cc) as part of the [Coop des Milieux](https://coopmilieux.org) activities
* Co-director of the [Coop des Milieux](https://coopmilieux.org)
* Co-CEO associate, in charge of pedagogy and administrative facilitator at [la Coopérative formations](https://formations.coop). 
* Conventional research : [[Histoire de la futurologie énergétique]] at the [EHESS](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/master-%C3%A9tudes-environnementales)
* Non-conventional and alternative research : [[Cosmotechniques des infrastructures énergétiques]]

### More details
I've worked in a major leading energy company, a state energy and environment agency and I've been implicated in various entrepreneurial and civic activities thoses past ten years. I've actively participated and contributed in the development of the citizen laboratory [la MYNE](https://lamyne.org), in which I've notably co-produced a citizen-action-research program on the initial topic "*what emerging IT technologies, such as [[Blockchains]], can bring to sustainable energy transition systems ?* " ([DAISEE](https://daisee.cc)). I'm currently an "*engineer-researcher-entrepreneur*" in the research cooperative company [Oxamyne](https://oxamyne.coop) in which, as part our various activities, we've initiated in 2019 the [Fabrique des énergies](https://fabenergies.cc) dynamics (supported by the state agency [ADEME](https://ademe.fr)) - now called the Fabrique des Bifurcations Énergétiques. Since the end of 2020, I'm alos co-CEO of the [Coopérative formations](https://formations.coop) company.

My current fieds of exploration and work are the future of critical infrastrutures (amongst which energy infrastructures) in VUCA - Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous - or TUNA - Turbulend, Uncertain, Novel, Ambiguous - and social, political, economical, technologican and technical reconfiguration contexts. 
As part of my research, I'm particularly interested in building the conditions for the emergence an structuration of commons at the territory scale for its resilience and sustanaibility. 
I'm more specifically focus on building a cosmotechnics thinking of the energy infrastructures in our society. 

Last but not least, I have a specific attention to ethical and responsible digital practices for collaboration, digital hygiene and individual and collective adaptation to shocks.
